After all, this is why engineers are paid: to produce text files full of variables and functions that, taken together, comprise a feature that product determines valuable.</p>\n<p>If I finished a day at work without having made a commit, I took this as a personal failure.</p>\n<h3>Pernicious Belief 3: Engineers Only Say “Yes”</h3>\n<p>Pushing back against the straight-forward, unidirectional, two-step system was akin to heresy. The product team knows the customer the best and engineering just builds product’s vision.</p>\n<p>Engineers are supposed to say “yes”. Say “yes” to product, say “yes” to the users, say “yes” to requirement changes, etc.</p>\n<h2>The Ease of “Yes”</h2>\n<p>As a software engineer, you are inclined to code. There is a lot of pressure to ship and “deliver value”. Product is always looking to move forward on their roadmap. Users are always waiting for new features and bug fixes. It becomes extremely easy to say “yes” to everything - especially when you align shipping with value.</p>\n<p>Yet, there are few pitfalls to being so amenable. By constantly saying “yes” you:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Treat the product organization as a boss instead of a teammate</li>\n<li>Surrender your personal input on the product’s vision</li>\n<li>Fail to ask why a feature should be built</li>\n<li>Most likely ship the WRONG feature</li>\n<li>Unintentionally signal your apathy or, worse, laziness</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Such an approach is the path of least resistance when it comes to software development. It is hard to step back, take a breath, and say “no”.</p>\n<h2>The Challenge of “No”</h2>\n<p>It can be difficult for engineers to say “no” to feature as they are ostensibly paid to build features. Saying “no” means value will not be delivered; it interferes with product’s roadmap and planning; it might nullify significant design resourcing or another team’s investment.</p>\n<p>Saying “no” can be difficult especially when senior leadership is driving an initiative. Attempting to stop such organizational momentum probably appears more troublesome than it is worth.</p>\n<p>It takes confidence to say “no - this feature is not worth it”.</p>\n<p>But, the first time you do, and successfully argue why, you will want to say it more often. Saying “no” means you have taken an active role in the product roadmap and are asking why features should be built. Saying “no” means you believe the return a feature promises does not justify the cost of its implementation. Saying “no” means you care about your product, your team, and your users.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Saying \"No\"","date":"December 23, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/saying-no/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/airtable-bootstrapping-made-easy/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Airtable: Bootstrapping Made Easy"}},"next":null}}
