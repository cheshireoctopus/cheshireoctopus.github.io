To do so, we designed and built landing page scoped to the following constraints:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Allow users to submit interest and personal data</li>\n<li>Store this data safely, in an easily <strong>accessible and manipulable</strong> format</li>\n<li>Retain control over all styling (no 3rd-party branding should be evident)</li>\n<li>No server-side code</li>\n<li>Completely static and easily deployable through <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\">Netlify</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>As we are bootstrapping Keming, we did not have an immediate requirement for a fully-fledged backend - even a basic <a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/flask\">Flask</a> application felt like overkill.

The <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs\">documentation for Firebase</a> is a salient example. However, I found the Google Sheets API documentation to be lacking and its implementation to complicated for such a simple project.</p>\n<p>I briefly considered using Firebase as it is my standard for prototyping, but decided against it as it does not provide an interface for easily accessing and manipulating data.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, I wanted to scratch that itch to use a new API…</p>\n<h2>Airtable</h2>\n<!-- ![airtable logo](./airtable-logo.png) -->\n<p>Enter <a href=\"https://airtable.com/\">Airtable</a>.
