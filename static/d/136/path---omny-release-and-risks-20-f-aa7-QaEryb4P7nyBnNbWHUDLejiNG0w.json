A computer issue knocked a considerable amount of card readers offline and roughly <strong>one million</strong> rides were given away during the first weeks after launch.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Chicago failed to adequately prepare its citizens for the update:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thousands of Chicago Card customers did not receive Ventra cards in the mail, and many of those who did either didn’t receive activation instructions via email or they misplaced the emails in the long span between receiving the emails and their Ventra cards.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even worse:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Myriad other problems followed, including customers being double-charged for rides using Ventra cards; deposits to Ventra accounts failing to be properly credited; and Ventra card readers deducting fares from other contactless cards in riders’ wallets or purses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thankfully, the MTA has been able to learn from Chicago’s mistakes and is rolling OMNY out much like you’d expect enterprise software to be released:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Small, internal test with a few dozen workers</li>\n<li>Slightly larger, still internal test with 1,500 workers</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amny.com/transit/metrocard-replacement-omny-1.29297988\">“Deliberatley small”</a> public pilot at just a few stations</li>\n<li>A customer support team has been set up at 511 to handle OMNY-related questions</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>OMNY Risks</h2>\n<p>Beyond the release, </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>System</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Variance in performance of contactless cards</li>\n<li>Potential software/hardware anomalies</li>\n<li>Network comms</li>\n<li>Volume stress test</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Customer experience</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Market penetration of contactless cards</li>\n<li>Changing customer habits and expectations</li>\n<li>New transit transaction model (TTM)</li>\n<li>Open payment transactions are sometimes slower.

That’s nearly as fast as the blink of an eye, or a heartbeat. The seamlessness of contactless pay will hopefully reduce fare evasion, as well. “People say they jump the turnstile because they swipe the card, realize they don’t have enough fare, and the train’s coming,” said Brunner. “Now that you can pay with your credit card, there’s no problem of ‘Oh, I don’t have any fare, I need to go back to the booth.’”</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>MetroCards currently cost a $1</li>\n<li>Any impact on “swiping it forward”</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pretax transit benefits?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Meanwhile, commuters who sign up for pretax transit benefit programs through their employers learned that the information provided to Ventra isn’t secure.
