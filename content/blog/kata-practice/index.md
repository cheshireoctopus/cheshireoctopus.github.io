Do you practice?

In every field, practice is as important as theory
  - theory teaches you why
  - practices makes you understand

Last time I remembering "practicing"
  - scales on the piano
  - laps on the track
  - problems in mathematics text books

Practicing === repetition

"We choose a repertoire of problem/solution pairs and execute them over and over again until we know them cold."

Dave Thomas, author of Pragmatic Programmer is credited with introducing Katas to the programming world

Deliberate practice - a special type of practice that is purposeful and systematic. Regular practice might include mindless reps, deliberate practice requries focusd attention and is conducted with the specific goal of improving performance.
