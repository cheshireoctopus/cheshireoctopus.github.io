title: 'Slack Keyword Notifications'

Today I learned about [keyword notifications](https://slack.com/help/articles/201398467-Set-up-keyword-notifications) in Slack. Today I also learned my Slack game is pretty weak.

This is a neat little feature that allows users to enter a list of comma-separated words and receive a notification when one of those words is entered in a channel the user is participating.

I am using the feature to notify myself when my GitHub handle is mentioned in a channel that notifies our engineering team when builds are ready for production. Our automated system tags each Slack notification with the GitHub handle who initiated the build. There is probably a way to modify the the automated system with mappings from these GitHub handles to our Slack handles, but the keyword notifications work for now.

This leaves me wondering really how well I know the products I use almost daily...
