Today I had the opportunity to speak with a group of 7th grade students about programming and a career in software engineering.

These students gave up their lunch period for the opportunity to learn.

Below are their unedited questions. Common themes were learning tips, career advice, and, surprising to me, the intersection of art and code.

I found it heart-warming that such young individuals could ask such poignant questions. It gives me great hope for the future.
