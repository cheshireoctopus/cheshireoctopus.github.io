If you have 25 minutes to spare, I highly recommend watching Dave Wascha's [20 Years of Product Management in 25 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69U0lvi89c&feature=share).

Wascha is the current CPO at [Photo Box](https://www.photobox.co.uk/) and began his career as the product manager for [IE 4.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_4).

His talk, geared towards product managers but applicable to all disciplines across the product organization, encapsulates his learnings from 20 years of successes and failures.

Here is a list of personal learnings from it:

## Listen To Customers
* The PM's responsibility is to be "manically focused on customer problems"
* Cannot solve the customers problem without understanding it
* Cannot understand the problem if you do not listen
* When you don’t listen to your customers, you build solutions to problems that no one has

## Don’t Listen to Customers (when it comes to solutions)
* Customers are the least qualified people to come up with solutions

## Watch the Competition
* The competition is a rich source of information to understand customer issues
* Each new feature the competition ships should be viewed as a user test

## Don’t Watch the Competition
* Is implementing a new trend / technology really help my customers solve their problem?

## Be a Thief
* PM’s do not have to come up with all the ideas
* Your job is to solve customer problems - if the competition has a great solution - steal it!

## Get Paid
* Most PM’s work in commercial endeavors - a lot of time is spent brining features to market
* Forgot to ask if people will actually pay for what we have built
* What is the customer’s willingness to pay for a solution?
* People need to see enough value in what you are building to pay for it
* PM’s need to solve their customers’ problems - not their company’s

## Stop Worrying About Getting Paid
* “Business-casing the soul out of our products”
* Forced to justify every change and idea
* Slows velocity

> “Creates a culture of systematic risk aversion”

> “Creates a culture of small incremental thinking driving small incremental gains”
* No longer enough  to appeal to just the functional needs of customers - also need to appeal to emotional and social needs
	* Customers want a relationship
	* Customers want to believe that we have their best interest at heart
* Not all features need to be justified by ROI

## Speed Up
* Need to consider the “cost of delay”
* How much value is lost by not taking action
* Everytime a decision is put off, you are destroying value
* Products have a limited shelf-life - the longer it takes them to get to market the less value they have

## Say, “No”
* Lots of stake holders, competingting priorities, lots of people to make happy
* Only the customer’s demands should matter
* But don’t say no for the wrong reasons:
	* Protecting the team
	* Don’t like the person
* Make sure you are saying no for the right reasons

## Don’t Be A Visionary
> Products don’t need visionaries they need product managers who are obsessed with understanding the customer’s problem and solving it.

## Don’t Confuse Yourself with Your Customer
> A product manager that thinks they really know their customer is like a male gynocologist

## Be Dumb
> You have a precious gift when you are starting off. You are not encumbered by knowledge and you are not encumbered by inertia. 
* Best PM’s have a capacity to be dumb - to always look at a situation through the eyes of a customer
* Companies drift and lose sight of mission and begin solving their problems, not their customers
