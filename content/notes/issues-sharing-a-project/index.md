Today I learned about challenges sharing a project across teams as a tech lead.

A month ago, my team and another team kicked off a shared project. Both teams would work to build the foundation of this new project before splitting out additional feature work on top of the foundation.

Here are some of the challenges I have encountered during this shared-work saga:

1. Communication - does the right hand know what the left is up to?
2. Different team processes, standards, and conceptions lead to lack of alignment
3. Working not with just more developers, but more designers, product people, and managers
4. More pull requests to review and more VQA/UAT to perform
