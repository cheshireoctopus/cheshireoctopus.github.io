Today I learned that, according to Larry Wall, the creator of Perl, there are [three great virtues of a programmer](http://threevirtues.com/):

1. Laziness
2. Impatience
3. Hubris

**Laziness** is what makes one go to great lengths to save time in the future. You create programs to save yourself and other people time. You ensure these programs are well tested and documented so you do not have to waste more time fixing issues and answers questions.

**Impatience** is what you feel when your code takes too long to compile, when your application loads too slow over a cellular connection, or when the process to deploy has too many steps.

**Hubris** is what makes you write and maintain code that others won't talk shit about.
