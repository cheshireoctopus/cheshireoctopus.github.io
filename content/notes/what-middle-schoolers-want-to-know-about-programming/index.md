Almost a year ago to the day I wrote about [What Seventh Graders Want to Know About Programming](/writing/what-seventh-graders-want-to-know-about-programming/). This year, I was given the same opportunity to speak to a group of middle school students from the same school about programming. Below are their unedited questions.

Themes this year were learning tips, video games, and career questions.

## Questions

1. How long did it take you to truly become good at coding. Was it hard, confusing?
2. During the process of learning about computer programming, what was the most difficult trial you have faced during the learning process?
3. What would you call a coding masterpiece?
4. How do you create a website, and how to make websites link to another?
5. When programming and inserting codes into a program, is it mandatory/do you have to memorize all of the codes that you need to put into the program? Or do you have some kind of code sheet with general codes?
6. What your favorite coding language?
7. How does coding work? Is it like Minecraft? Just put something in a certain order, certain form, and then you get something else? Would it be like taking items and just crafting whatever you can? And is it easy?
8. How long would it take to code a game all by yourself?
9. If I want to design a video game of some sort, what basic skill would be required to do so?
10. What happens if you mess up on a line of code after working on the code for hours?
11. What is one of the hardest projects youâ€™ve had to take on and what made it so difficult?
