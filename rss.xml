Needless to say, I was a bit timid! From what I had heard, a tech lead mixes two opposing sets of skills — manager-esque activities and software engineer expectations — with not exactly enough time to really focus on both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is no shortage of fantastic writing on the tech lead role and its functions, I wanted to contribute my thoughts to the discussion by sharing ten things I have learned about the role since I stepped into it. Hopefully, these reflections will help aspiring tech leads navigate their own transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Be Patient&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure that you are patient with yourself as you transition into the role. You will be departing from a familiar routine you’ve spent your career mastering and picking up an entirely new set of responsibilities. Leaving your comfort zone is scary. No one, including yourself, will expect you to navigate this transition seamlessly. You will have questions. You will be uncertain of yourself. Yes, you might even make mistakes. Just remember, you were given the role for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Lead By Example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A particular challenge of the role is that you must rely on influence, as opposed to authority, to see your vision for the team carried out. The number one strategy here is to be the change you wish to see and lead by example. If you want clear acceptance criteria on tickets, be sure to write clear acceptance criteria for your tickets. If you want the team to share knowledge, publicly offer to pair on a ticket and share your knowledge first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another tip: be sure to praise behaviors you wish to see more of publicly. Whether you realize it or not, you are in a position of leadership and the team is looking at you for guidance on how you work together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Strengthen the Team&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team is your number one responsibility as a tech lead. Learn to embrace the role of “multiplier” as your job is to strengthen the skills and confidence of your fellow team members with the end goal being to improve the overall output and quality of work of the team. There are several ways to go about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, get to know a bit more about each member of your team. Ask them what they are trying to learn and how you can help. For example, is a team member trying to expand their knowledge across the stack? Does a QA engineer want to focus on more product work? Be sure to regularly remind your teammates that you are there to help them grow as it can be difficult to get some people to take you up on this offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you understand what your teammates are looking to learn, work with your engineering and product managers to identify well-scoped challenges your teammates grow. Make sure you become an advocate for your teammates here. Always be on the lookout for ways they can improve and communicate this with them frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t expect your work to end there: be prepared to spend a lot of your time pair programming. Invest time in learning &lt;a href=&quot;https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html&quot;&gt;pair programming strategies&lt;/a&gt; and how to do it effectively. You have valuable experience to share, and it is your job to share it! That said, do not be surprised if your teammates do not immediately take you up on your offer to pair. It takes time to build trust to a point where someone might reach out to you for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, your responsibility to the team does not end with your fellow engineers. Be sure you are working to support the designers and product people on your team as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Promote Ownership&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autonomy as an engineer is important. We want to feel that we have a stake in what we are building and that we are useful to the organization beyond just implementing code. Likewise, we want to work in highly autonomous, empowered teams that often feel more motivated and productive. Be sure to encourage ownership amongst your team members. Get them excited to lead initiatives, no matter the size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Take A Back Seat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t be afraid to let someone else lead. You might feel that because of the “lead” in your title that you alone are responsible for every decision the team makes. This could not be further from the truth. Again, your job is to strengthen your team and what better way to do so than by taking a back seat and encouraging your teammates to lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond taking ownership of projects as mentioned above, there are many other ways to promote leadership. It can be as small as asking someone for their opinion during a meeting. If you are discussing a ticket during planning and you have questions about how the ticket will be QA’ed, make sure to publicly ask the QA engineer. Even if you know the answer, giving your teammates center stage and the ability to share their expertise is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another great way to promote leadership, especially among your more junior colleagues, is to get their input on implementations. Better yet, ask to pair with them and have them walk through a problem they are working on or a piece of the system they are familiar with. This has a dual benefit of providing your teammate with confidence in their abilities, and you might even get to learn something new. Search “&lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2019/10/why-reverse-mentoring-works-and-how-to-do-it-right&quot;&gt;reverse mentoring&lt;/a&gt;” for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. Code Less&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expect the time you spend coding to decrease. By how much will depend on your firm, the size of your team, and the size of your backlog. I struggled with this point. It was difficult passing on tickets I knew I could rip through to focus on other work. It took a few months to understand that it was perfectly acceptable if I did not commit against the codebase every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, you will not be abandoning the codebase entirely either, but expect to work more on architecture and systems design problems and get ready to read and write lots of technical documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are still itching to contribute directly to sprint work, remember to look for ways beyond coding to help move your team’s work along: offer to pair with someone on a challenging ticket, help write tests, perform QA, and pick up the work that nobody else wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. Listen More&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expect the time you spend in meetings to increase. You will be getting much more face-time with product managers, designers, and various stakeholders. Spend time preparing for these meetings. While your primary job is to strengthen your immediate team, you should also be working on gaining the trust of stakeholders from across the organization. Listen, take notes, and ask responsible questions. Show these stakeholders that the person charged with delivering their software solution cares deeply about their problem area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, take advantage of these meetings to observe the product development process at your firm and look for small ways to improve upon it. For example, advocate for increased representation from engineering earlier in the product development process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. Manage your Time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great piece of advice my manager gave me when I moved into the role was not to stretch myself thin. I recall laughing inside as I was a master of my time — how wrong I was. It is very easy to overload yourself in this role. Between writing technical design documents, shadowing designers on user interviews, planning the next sprint, and pairing with a team member, and putting out fires the role exposes you to a lot very quickly. Do yourself a favor and take the first few months slower than usual. You don’t want to burn out before you get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9. Learn the Business&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you should hopefully be familiar with the business your software supports, take it upon yourself to invest in building a detailed knowledge of your business’s internals. Start with the basics: how the company generates revenue and how your team contributes to the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To move beyond the basics, reach out to the leaders of the internal teams your software supports and ask for a question/answer session. One of my most impactful meetings at Ro was with a senior leader on the operations team who took the time to share his vision for the product and what success looked like for his team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;10. Support the Organization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, you and your team are writing code to support the organization. Thus, it only makes sense to get to know members of the organization beyond the engineering and product teams. Start with getting to know the non-technical people your code supports — become a resource to them. If they are relying on your code, be sure to let them know you care. Put on your product manager / design lead hat and set aside time to watch them use it. Ask about their workflows and what could be better. These conversations are invaluable as a tech lead: you become more acquainted with your users and their problems. At the same time, the organization as a whole begins to see you as a relatable engineer who cares about the product.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Starship Prompt]]></title><description><![CDATA[I have always wanted a tricked out command prompt, but have never invested much time in bash scripting aside from some simple functionality…]]></description><link>http://chandlermoisen.com/starship-prompt/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://chandlermoisen.com/starship-prompt/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jul 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I have always wanted a tricked out command prompt, but have never invested much time in bash scripting aside from some simple functionality around git and slight modifications to my prompt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# Check if repo is dirty&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; parse_git_dirty&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;diff&lt;/span&gt; --quiet --ignore-submodules HEAD 2&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;/dev/null&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$?&lt;/span&gt; -eq 1 &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;*&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# Branch name&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; parse_git_branch&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; branch --no-color 2&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; /dev/null &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;sed&lt;/span&gt; -e &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;/^[^*]/d&apos;&lt;/span&gt; -e &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;s/* \(.*\)/\1&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;parse_git_dirty&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# Prompt 1: &quot;username:&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;#PS1 is an environmental variable&lt;/span&gt;
PS1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;\e[38;5;201m\u\e[0m ✌ :&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# Prompt 2: &quot;path/to/where/you/are&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# Prompt 3: &quot;(gitbranch)&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily for me I recently came across &lt;a href=&quot;https://starship.rs/&quot;&gt;Starship&lt;/a&gt; - “the minimal, blazing-fast and infinitely customizable prompt for any shell!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;PUT&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;PATCH&lt;/code&gt; are &lt;strong&gt;similar&lt;/strong&gt; in that both are HTTP methods used to update RESTful resources. The methods &lt;strong&gt;differ&lt;/strong&gt; in the mechanics of how this updating occurs. In other words, a server will process the request body - the enclosed entity - of a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;PUT&lt;/code&gt; request different than that of a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;PATCH&lt;/code&gt; request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PUT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When processing a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;PUT&lt;/code&gt; request against a resource, a server will view the body of this request as the &lt;strong&gt;new&lt;/strong&gt; resource, essentially overwriting the existing resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, clients making &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;PUT&lt;/code&gt; request against a resource must send the &lt;strong&gt;entire&lt;/strong&gt; resource to ensure it remains intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PATCH&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, a server processing a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;PATCH&lt;/code&gt; request against a resource, views the body of the request as a &lt;strong&gt;partial&lt;/strong&gt; update to the resource. The existing resource is then modified versus being overwritten entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clients making &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;PATCH&lt;/code&gt; requests against a resource must only send the data to update as opposed to the entire resource.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Give Box Shadow a Border Radius]]></title><description><![CDATA[Today I learned how easy it is to apply a border radius to an element’s box shadow: just add  to the element!Allan, my co-founder at Keming…]]></description><link>http://chandlermoisen.com/how-to-give-box-shadow-border-radius/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://chandlermoisen.com/how-to-give-box-shadow-border-radius/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 25 May 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Today I learned how easy it is to apply a border radius to an element’s box shadow: just add &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;border-radius&lt;/code&gt; to the element!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially I thought that this would require modifying the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;box-shadow&lt;/code&gt; value in some way, but, much to my surprise and delight, an element’s box shadow will respect and reflect its &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;border-radius&lt;/code&gt; with no additional work required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, rather, I finally learned what this design trend I have been seeing for months on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://muz.li/&quot;&gt;Muzli&lt;/a&gt; feed is called.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term is a weak portmanteau of “new” and “skeuomorphism” - a design pattern where elements of a graphical user interface imitate their RL equivalent in either appearance or interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neumorphism is a visual design pattern where shadows are used to create the illusion of extruding shapes. These extrusions share the same coloring as their parent element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see an example of this technique using this &lt;a href=&quot;https://neumorphism.io/#950451&quot;&gt;generator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I am but a fledging designer, I lack the vocabulary to accurately critique this pattern, but it reminds me of pressing a shape through one of those elastic exercise bands. While certainly eye-catching, I am not sure of its applications in UI design as it makes all elements resemble button and would likely confuse users on what exactly they are supposed to interact with.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mock Low, Assert High]]></title><description><![CDATA[Today I learned the concept of mocking low and asserting high.When it comes to testing software you are often weighing test-fidelity against…]]></description><link>http://chandlermoisen.com/mock-low-assert-high/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://chandlermoisen.com/mock-low-assert-high/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 20 May 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Today I learned the concept of &lt;strong&gt;mocking low and asserting high&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to testing software you are often weighing test-fidelity against time spent writing and maintaining tests. In other words: how aggressive your tests are vs. how much time you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, we are able to write beautifully expansive end-to-end tests that cover each and every edge case and still have plenty of time left over to develop new features. For many of us, this ideal world remains beyond reach due to resourcing and the laws that govern space and time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are thus forced to make compromises. An approach to structuring your compromise can be found in the concept of mocking low and asserting high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assume we are testing a technology stack consisting of a database, an API, a client data layer (responsible for fetching and parsing server responses), a client rendering layer (think: React), and finally how a user is engaging with this application. You could model this stack by “depth” where the database is the deepest level of the stack and the user is at the top:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategy here is to test as many layers of the stack as possible as cheaply as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do so, mock as “low” in the stack as possible while asserting as “high” in the stack as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example we would mock the responses from the API (near the bottom of the stack) and assert what the user sees (at the top of the stack).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach favors testing what the user sees over implementation and is a good compromise to writing quality test.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Another Styled Component Pattern]]></title><description><![CDATA[Today I learned yet another styled-components pattern.styled-components is an approach to writing CSS within JavaScript.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://styled-components.com/&quot;&gt;styled-components&lt;/a&gt; is an approach to writing CSS within JavaScript. It uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals&quot;&gt;tagged template literals&lt;/a&gt; to enable the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; styled &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;styled-components&apos;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; Button &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; styled&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`
  color: #0974EC;

  &amp;amp;:hover {
    color: #EC2509;
  }
`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great feature of styled-components is that you can wrap your application in a global theme provider and each styled component instance has access to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; styled &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;styled-components&apos;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; Button &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; styled&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`
  color: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; theme &lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;) =&gt; theme.color.blue};

  &amp;amp;:hover {
    color: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; theme &lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;) =&gt; theme.color.red};
  }
`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is a whole debate to be had about the CSS-in-JS approach, I have found working with styled-components to be mostly pleasant save one aspect: having to pollute my components with the interpolated &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;${({ theme }) =&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in order to access the global theme. I have found that I am often using this interpolation 5+ times for each styled component I build 😱.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That all changed today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I&amp;#39;ve found you can further simplify this! This is how I write my styled-components now: &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/LTQJfG96o1&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/LTQJfG96o1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Drake @ PDX (@Saeris) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Saeris/status/1262441528078688256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 18, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google Fonts in Gatsby]]></title><description><![CDATA[There are a number of ways to use Google Fonts within a Gatsby application.

In other platforms, we could simply add &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;link&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; file and call it day. However, as Gatsby generates the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; during its build process, we are unable to modify the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; file directly. As such, we have to find another way to inject Google Fonts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot has already been written about &lt;a href=&quot;http://kyleamathews.github.io/typography.js/&quot;&gt;Typography.js&lt;/a&gt;, so this post will compare the pros and cons of three other approaches:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Link tag and React Helmet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gatsby-plugin-google-fonts&lt;/code&gt; package&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gatsby-plugin-prefetch-google-fonts&lt;/code&gt; package&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: this blog uses the third approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. The Link tag and React Helmet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most straight forward approach, and perhaps the approach most similar to placing the Google Font embed link within &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, is to place the embed into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet&quot;&gt;React Helmet&lt;/a&gt; component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;React Helmet is a library for managing all of the tags that are rendered within the document head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you used a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/&quot;&gt;Gatsby starter&lt;/a&gt;, your project most likely already includes the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gatsby-plugin-react-helmet&lt;/code&gt; library and you do not need to install React Helmet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To implement this approach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// layout.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; Helmet &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;react-helmet&apos;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;Helmet&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;link
    href&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Yeseva+One&amp;amp;display=swap&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    rel&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;stylesheet&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;link
    href&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Open+Sans:ital,wght@0,400;0,700;1,400&amp;amp;display=swap&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    rel&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;stylesheet&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;Helmet&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: place this component in a top-level container so that it gets included across the application&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pros&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Straight-forward and familiar if you are new to Gatsby&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flash of Invisible Text (FOIT) as the external resource is loaded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hard-codes fonts instead of relying on Gatsby’s configuration &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gatsby-plugin-google-fonts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gatsby-plugin-google-fonts&lt;/code&gt; makes use of Gatsby’s plugin ecosystem and configuration to load Google Fonts. In other words, instead of hard-coding your &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;link&lt;/code&gt; embeds as in the prior approach, you instead would set them within your &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gatsby-config.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// gatsby-config.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  resolve&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;gatsby-plugin-google-fonts&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  options&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    fonts&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;yeseva one&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;open sans\:400,400i,700&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    display&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;swap&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: the syntax to load multiple font variants is interesting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pros&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leverages Gatsby’s plugin ecosystem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keeps configuration within the appropriate config file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FOIT as the external resource is loaded &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gatsby-plugin-prefetch-google-fonts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to previous approach, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gatsby-plugin-prefetch-google-fonts&lt;/code&gt; also leverages Gatsby’s configuration settings, but, please be advised:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THIS PLUGIN IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED BY ITS AUTHOR!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is quite unfortunate as it avoids the FOIT that both of the previous approaches suffer from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Flash of Invisible Text is the result of the browser waiting to load the external font resources while the page loads. While this issue can be mitigated using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;font-display&lt;/code&gt; property, there will still be the slightest flicker as the browser’s fallback font is replaced with the Google font. To read more about FOIT and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;font-display&lt;/code&gt; go &lt;a href=&quot;https://fontsplugin.com/google-fonts-font-display-swap/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, if you are comfortable using an unsupported library and want to avoid the flashing text issues, then this approach is for you. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gatsby-plugin-prefetch-google-fonts&lt;/code&gt; works by prefetching the font resources during Gatsby’s build process and including these resources in your build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use the plugin, add it to your &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gatsby-config.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// gatsby-config.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  resolve&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;gatsby-plugin-prefetch-google-fonts&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  options&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    fonts&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        family&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Yeseva One&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        family&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Open Sans&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        variants&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;400&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;400i&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;700&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Build Errors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that you must correctly capitalize the font family in the configuration file otherwise your build will fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, comparing &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Open Sans&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt; vs. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Open sans&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt; - the lower-cased &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sans&lt;/code&gt; will cause the prefetching to fail and the following error to show during the build:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoids the FOIT as resources are included in the Gatsby build&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leverages Gatsby’s plugin ecosystem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keeps configuration withing the appropriate config file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unsupported library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Potential for build errors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unsupported library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you made it this far, you just learned three approaches to loading Google Fonts within a Gatsby application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog that you are reading this on uses the third approach as I like to include the the font resources in the build to avoid fetching them when the document loads causing flashing text.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Testing Goals]]></title><description><![CDATA[Today I learned a simple yet thought-provoking question to ask when determining your testing strategy: “what errors are we hoping to catch…]]></description><link>http://chandlermoisen.com/testing-goals/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://chandlermoisen.com/testing-goals/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 14 May 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Today I learned a simple yet thought-provoking question to ask when determining your testing strategy: &lt;strong&gt;“what errors are we hoping to catch?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A colleague with a deep background in automated test writing asked me this question while I was sharing a new test approach with him. When I commented on the quality of the question, he said that he asks it to learn if the tests are actually valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a version of a question a previous director taught me to ask when contemplating a new feature: &lt;strong&gt;“what problem are we solving?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[TestCafe Request Hooks]]></title><description><![CDATA[Today I learned about intercepting HTTP requests using TestCafe request hooks.I have recently incorporated writing automated end-to-end…]]></description><link>http://chandlermoisen.com/testcafe-request-hooks/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://chandlermoisen.com/testcafe-request-hooks/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 13 May 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Today I learned about intercepting HTTP requests using &lt;a href=&quot;https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/documentation/guides/advanced-guides/intercept-http-requests.html&quot;&gt;TestCafe request hooks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have recently incorporated writing automated end-to-end tests into my workflow using &lt;a href=&quot;https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/&quot;&gt;TestCafe&lt;/a&gt;. When writing such tests (or any tests for that matter) you might find yourself in a situation where you need to mock an external service. TestCafe allows mocking of services via its &lt;a href=&quot;https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/documentation/reference/test-api/requestmock/&quot;&gt;RequestMock class&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting up mocks to run before a series of tests is straight forward. For example, if you are testing a UI that is only accessible to authorized users, you can mock out the authorization request as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; RequestMock&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Selector &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;testcafe&apos;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; authMock &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;RequestMock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;onRequestTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;http://localhost/api/auth&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;respond&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    token&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;abc123&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;fixtures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Profile Page&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;http://localhost:3000/profile&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;requestHooks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;authMock&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mirage.js]]></title><description><![CDATA[Today I learned about Mirage.js while building tooling to support acceptance tests for a new client-side application.Getting the acceptance…]]></description><link>http://chandlermoisen.com/mirage-js/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://chandlermoisen.com/mirage-js/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 12 May 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Today I learned about &lt;a href=&quot;https://miragejs.com&quot;&gt;Mirage.js&lt;/a&gt; while building tooling to support acceptance tests for a new client-side application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting the acceptance test suite up and running was not very challenging thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/&quot;&gt;TestCafe&lt;/a&gt;. What has proven more difficult is how we plan to handle fixture data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was stumped until a few colleagues recommend shimming the API and one suggested I look into Mirage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mirage is an API mocking tool that runs in the browser. It was built with frontend developers in mind and, from first glance, appears to provide a great developer experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It works by intercepting &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;XHR&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt; requests and letting the developer mock responses. As it mocks the HTTP boundary, the client code does not need to be modified to tell it speak with Mirage versus your actual server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a code example lifted from the docs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// index.js&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; React &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;react&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond mocking an API, and what really has me interested, is that Mirage also contains a mock database that stores data and can setup relationships between various data models. Again, lifted from the docs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The law argues that the total complexity in any system is constant. If you were to simplify one component of the system, you would ultimately end up creating more complexity in another component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example of this law, I, a product developer, work with designers to simplify user-facing components of software systems. In other words, we remove complexity from the user-facing parts of these systems. This complexity is not banished from the system, however. Instead, this complexity manifest itself elsewhere in the system, most likely in a complicated API or data model.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Three Great Virtues of a Programmer]]></title><description><![CDATA[Today I learned that, according to Larry Wall, the creator of Perl, there are three great virtues of a programmer…]]></description><link>http://chandlermoisen.com/three-great-virtues-of-a-programmer/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://chandlermoisen.com/three-great-virtues-of-a-programmer/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 08 May 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Today I learned that, according to Larry Wall, the creator of Perl, there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://threevirtues.com/&quot;&gt;three great virtues of a programmer&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laziness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impatience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hubris&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laziness&lt;/strong&gt; is what makes one go to great lengths to save time in the future. You create programs to save yourself and other people time. You ensure these programs are well tested and documented so you do not have to waste more time fixing issues and answers questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impatience&lt;/strong&gt; is what you feel when your code takes too long to compile, when your application loads too slow over a cellular connection, or when the process to deploy has too many steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hubris&lt;/strong&gt; is what makes you write and maintain code that others won’t talk shit about.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Challenges Sharing a Project]]></title><description><![CDATA[Today I learned about challenges sharing a project across teams as a tech lead.A month ago, my team and another team kicked off a shared…]]></description><link>http://chandlermoisen.com/issues-sharing-a-project/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://chandlermoisen.com/issues-sharing-a-project/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 07 May 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Today I learned about challenges sharing a project across teams as a tech lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A month ago, my team and another team kicked off a shared project. Both teams would work to build the foundation of this new project before splitting out additional feature work on top of the foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the challenges I have encountered during this shared-work saga:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communication - does the right hand know what the left is up to?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different team processes, standards, and conceptions lead to lack of alignment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working not with just more developers, but more designers, product people, and managers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More pull requests to review and more VQA/UAT to perform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Call it 'Product Debt']]></title><description><![CDATA[Today I learned that we should call “technical debt” by another name: “product debt”.While reading about shifting the framing of success as…]]></description><link>http://chandlermoisen.com/call-it-product-debt/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://chandlermoisen.com/call-it-product-debt/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 May 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Today I learned that we should call “technical debt” by another name: “product debt”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While reading about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.svese.de/impact-vs-backlog-frame-in-software-development&quot;&gt;shifting the framing of success as a developer&lt;/a&gt; I came across this provoking thought:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always wondered why it isn’t called “product debt” because product took the credit to get a feature faster and must pay back by investing the time to clean up. Technology is the bank that gave credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author of the article is arguing that as the modern development teams are driven by their backlogs and that success is defined as clearing the log. As such, developers who are under pressure to ship end up creating technical debt - a term the author states developers made up “because it sounds better than cutting corners and with the hope it is repaid.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I like about this change in name is that it places the onus of responsibility on product to find the time in the backlog to repay the debt.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Questions For Postmortems]]></title><description><![CDATA[Today I learned more questions to ask during a postmortem.This afternoon I sat in on a postmortem for a production issue.

&lt;p&gt;This afternoon I sat in on a postmortem for a production issue. This was my first postmortem with Ro since our site-reliability team had revamped the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Included in this process were two questions I am quite familiar with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What went well?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What could be improved?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were two other questions that I have not seen asked before:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where did we get lucky?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What were we wrong about?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like these latter questions as they force the team to acknowledge the fragility of certain systems - to “turn over the rock” as we say at Ro - and to reconsider our understanding of systems, user behavior, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Publish More Incident Reports]]></title><description><![CDATA[Today I learned that developers should publish more incident reports.I say this after reading Forbes Lindesay’s post mortem report on how a…]]></description><link>http://chandlermoisen.com/publish-more-incident-reports/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://chandlermoisen.com/publish-more-incident-reports/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 May 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Today I learned that developers should publish more incident reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say this after reading Forbes Lindesay’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/is-promise-post-mortem-cab807f18dcc&quot;&gt;post mortem report&lt;/a&gt; on how a regression in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-promise&quot;&gt;is-promise&lt;/a&gt;. package he maintains took down &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm create-react-app&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/then/is-promise/issues/13&quot;&gt;for a hot second&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lindesay’s report is a must-read for any aspiring open-source maintainer or engineering leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It lays out in clear language:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mistakes that were made&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An incident timeline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Context around factors leading to the mistakes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steps implemented to prevent future issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, this incident serves as another warning to developers that our code is built upon the work of open-source maintainers who demonstratively have the power to disrupt our own applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, the way in which Lindesay handled the situation is impressive and sets a high standard for all developers. We’ve all broken something - yet how many of us actually take the time to publish (even internally) why it happened and how we are working to prevent it from happening in the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also makes me wonder at what point does a regression demand a public post-mortem?

&lt;p&gt;While attempting to replicate a bug, I asked the reporter to share her testing credentials so that I could replicate the bug and investigate the network traffic in my browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another colleague suggested she simply share her network traffic with me by exporting a HAR file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can think of a HAR file as a snapshot or record of all network request between a browser and a server. Each time the browser makes an additional request, another entry is appended the HAR file. Each entry contains pertinent information one would need to debug a failed network requests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;URL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;request/response headers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cookie values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;response HTTP status code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;response content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this list feels familiar that is because the network tab in Chrome developer tools is a UI layer on top of a HAR file!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To export/import a HAR file in Chrome, open developer tools and navigate to the “Network” tab and use the appropriate arrow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is that you can analyze threats to a system by breaking the system into steps. While each step will undoubtedly have holes representing failures in that particular step of the system, because the next layer of the system does not have a hole in the same place, a threat is not able to pass beyond that  layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Threats to a system thus arise when layer after layer has a hole in the same place:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I like about this approach is that it considers failure to be systemic as opposed to being the cause of one particular individual. In recent years, technologists have adopted a similar approach with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://codeascraft.com/2012/05/22/blameless-postmortems/&quot;&gt;blameless post-mortem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have spent more than a few minutes working in technology you know you are destined to encounter failure within in your systems be it due to your code, your colleagues’ code, third-party vendors’ code, network issues, some manual process that only one person knows how to perform, or one of the countless other points of failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failure in software is part of the game and controlling for it represents a lot of what we do. That said, as technologists, we get to decide how we respond to failure. Do we blame the individual who happened to click the wrong button at the wrong time? Or, do we blame the system as a whole and analyze what enabled the person to click the wrong button in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Export Named Components]]></title><description><![CDATA[Today I learned that you should export named components as opposed to anonymous functions.Came across the following tweet in my company’s…]]></description><link>http://chandlermoisen.com/export-named-components/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://chandlermoisen.com/export-named-components/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 29 Apr 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Today I learned that you should export named components as opposed to anonymous functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Came across the following tweet in my company’s frontend chat this morning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;If you write &amp;quot;export default () =&amp;gt; { ... }&amp;quot; to declare components, they:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- will show up as Anonymous in stack traces&lt;br&gt;- will show up as Unknown in DevTools&lt;br&gt;- won&amp;#39;t be checked by React-specific lint rules&lt;br&gt;- won&amp;#39;t work with some features like Fast Refresh&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Give components names!&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Dan Abramov (@dan_abramov) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1255229440860262400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 28, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, I have been naming my default exports ever since a colleague commented on a pull request that including a name made it easier for them to search for the component in their IDE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, I must admit, while I was aware that anonymous functions would show up as &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;anonymous&lt;/code&gt; in a stack trace, I never once gave thought to how this behavior would translate to exporting an anonymous function by default. Further, I never considered the implications of this when it comes to exporting React components!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t come across how the browser console displays an anonymous function’s stack trace, you can easily demo this using an immediately-invoked function expression. Executing the following code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Herp derp&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;would yield the following in your browser’s console:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hold a love-hate relationship with the New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I respect both the quality of the NYT’s journalism and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/projects/2020-report/index.html&quot;&gt;standards&lt;/a&gt; they hold themselves to as journalists. They are doing an amazing job of delivering digital content via high-visual, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/us/2018-year-in-graphics.html&quot;&gt;innovative experiences&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the reason I pursued software engineering as a career was due to data-driven journalism that was pioneered at the Times by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://d3js.org/&quot;&gt;D3.js library&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Customer Problems vs. Business Problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, the core functionality of their mobile application - to enable readers to comprehend traditional articles - is abysmal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet advertisements are to blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Times &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/services/mobile/index.html&quot;&gt;mobile application&lt;/a&gt; is one of the few products I use - if not the only product - that bombards &lt;strong&gt;paying users&lt;/strong&gt; with internet advertisements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just this morning I read an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/26/nyregion/cruise-ship-exhaust-shore-power-nyc.html&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; containing &lt;strong&gt;sixteen&lt;/strong&gt; advertisements. One of which, for an article titled “How Cruise Ships Bring 1,200 Tons of Toxic Fumes to Brooklyn a Year”, was particularly ironic: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have written previously about &lt;a href=&quot;/customer-problems-vs-business-problems/&quot;&gt;customer problems vs business problems&lt;/a&gt;. When a business prioritizes its problems at the expense of its customers, the customers’ user experience undoubtedly suffers. This is a textbook case of a product team solving for their business problems instead of their customer problems. The NYT’s digital product team is prioritizing revenue generation through internet advertisements over their readers’ user experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This egregious level of advertisements makes it difficult for readers to fully comprehend the article they are paying for as their concentration is broken every few paragraphs by advertising that has little-to-no relevance to the true content they are hoping to consume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing worse than making it difficult for paying customers to enjoy distraction-free content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Banish The Ads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of ways to banish the ads from the articles you are paying to read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a a web browser with an ad-blocker like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/privacybadger&quot;&gt;Privacy Badger&lt;/a&gt; enabled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Safari’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/03/technology/personaltech/safari-reader-mode.html&quot;&gt;Reader Mode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install a VPN like &lt;a href=&quot;https://nordvpn.com/&quot;&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; on your mobile device and make sure you are blocking advertisements in your settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This misconception led to a series of pernicious beliefs in how I approached daily work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pernicious Belief 1: Shipping == Value&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineering is only responsible for shipping as shipping is the most visible mechanism for realizing an engineering’s value. An engineer’s value to the organization is worthless until they smashed that “Merge pull request” button.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pernicious Belief 2: Engineers Are Paid to Code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of an engineer’s time should be spent inside their IDE. After all, this is why engineers are paid: to produce text files full of variables and functions that, taken together, comprise a feature that product determines valuable. Anything beyond the scope of code is the domain of product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pernicious Belief 3: Say “Yes”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pushing back against the straight-forward, unidirectional, two-step system is akin to heresy. The product team understands the problem the best and engineering is there to build product’s vision. Engineers are supposed to say “yes”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Ease of “Yes”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a software engineer, you are inclined to code. There is a lot of pressure to ship and “deliver value”. Product is always looking to move forward on their roadmap. Users are always waiting for new features and bug fixes. It becomes extremely easy to say “yes” to everything - especially when you align shipping with value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, there are few pitfalls to being so amenable. By constantly saying “yes” you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treat the product organization as a boss instead of a teammate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surrender your personal input on the product’s vision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fail to ask why a feature should be built&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most likely ship WRONG features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unintentionally signal your apathy or, worse, laziness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such an approach is the path of least resistance when it comes to software development. It is hard to step back, thoroughly assess a proposal, and say “no”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Challenge of “No”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be difficult for engineers to say “no” to features as they are ostensibly paid to build features. Saying “no” means value will not be delivered; it interferes with product’s roadmap and planning; it might nullify significant design resourcing or another team’s investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying “no” can be difficult especially when senior leadership is driving an initiative. Attempting to stop such organizational momentum probably appears more troublesome than it is worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes confidence to say “no - this feature is not worth it”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, the first time you do, and successfully argue why, you will want to say it more often. Saying “no” means you have taken an active role in the product roadmap and are asking why features should be built. Saying “no” means you believe the return a feature promises does not justify the cost of its implementation. Saying “no” means you care about your product, your team, and your users.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Airtable: Bootstrapping Made Easy]]></title><description><![CDATA[For a new side project, Keming, my partner and I needed to quickly validate interest in our product.

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a new side project, &lt;a href=&quot;https://keming.io&quot;&gt;Keming&lt;/a&gt;, my partner and I needed to quickly validate interest in our product. To do so, we designed and built a landing page scoped to the following constraints:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow users to submit interest and personal data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Store this data safely, in an easily &lt;strong&gt;accessible and manipulable&lt;/strong&gt; format&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retain control over all styling (no 3rd-party branding should be evident)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No server-side code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Completely static and easily deployable through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netlify.com/&quot;&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we are bootstrapping Keming, we did not have an immediate requirement for a fully-fledged backend - even a basic &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pallets/flask&quot;&gt;Flask&lt;/a&gt; application felt like overkill. At the same time, we did not want to release with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/forms/about/&quot;&gt;Google Form&lt;/a&gt; as we hypothesized it would put-off our target market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My initial thought was to create a form that submits to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/sheets/api&quot;&gt;Google Sheets API&lt;/a&gt;. Having consumed Google’s API’s for years, I believed this would be a straight forward experience as the quality of their API design and documentation is typically superb. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://firebase.google.com/docs&quot;&gt;documentation for Firebase&lt;/a&gt; is a salient example. However, I found the Google Sheets API documentation to be lacking and its implementation too complicated for such a simple project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I briefly considered using Firebase as it is my standard for prototyping, but decided against it as. While it does provide an interface for accessing and manipulating data, this data would have to be accessed by non-technical persons and Firebase’s UI-representation for its NoSQL DB can be frightening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I wanted to scratch that itch to use a new API…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Airtable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href=&quot;https://airtable.com/&quot;&gt;Airtable&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to clear API documentation, I had a solution up and running in less than 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is how easy it was to integrate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/airtable&quot;&gt;Airtable’s npm package&lt;/a&gt; with a React form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Form.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;REACT_APP_AIRTABLE_API_KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;REACT_APP_AIRTABLE_BASE_ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; process&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;env

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; base &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Airtable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  apiKey&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;REACT_APP_AIRTABLE_API_KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;base&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;REACT_APP_AIRTABLE_BASE_ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;onSubmit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, take the totally banal task of filtering falsy values from an array.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I typically perform this task in one of two ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either, passing a function to JavaScript’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter&quot;&gt;Array.prototype.filter&lt;/a&gt; that simply returns each value in the array and relies on truthiness for filtering:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; array &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; filteredArray &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; array&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, leveraging a utility like &lt;a href=&quot;https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#compact&quot;&gt;LoDash’s compact&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; array &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; filteredArray &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; _&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;compact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;array&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While both approaches solve the problem, both feel inelegant. In the first example I dislike the redundancy of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;(value =&amp;gt; value)&lt;/code&gt;. In the second, I feel guilty reaching for a utility when JavaScript provides native array filtering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, I came across a third approach I find much more appealing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; array &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; filteredArray &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; array&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Boolean&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Native &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; not redundant!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[What Seventh Graders Want to Know About Programming]]></title><description><![CDATA[Today I had the opportunity to speak with a group of 7th grade students about programming and a career in software engineering.These…]]></description><link>http://chandlermoisen.com/what-seventh-graders-want-to-know-about-programming/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://chandlermoisen.com/what-seventh-graders-want-to-know-about-programming/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Today I had the opportunity to speak with a group of 7th grade students about programming and a career in software engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These students gave up their lunch period for the opportunity to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are their unedited questions. Common themes were learning tips, career advice, and, surprising to me, the intersection of art and code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found it heart-warming that such young individuals could ask such poignant questions. It gives me great hope for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What program did you learn first?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When did you start programming and with what language?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much do you make per year?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How would you program a game using pre-existing art?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where do I start?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did you start your programming career?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was it hard to become a professional in programming?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you suggest tips to become a pro programmer?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do I get a job for coding?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What food is best to eat before extensive and intensive coding/web designing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How closely does coding and art go together?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In animation, how does coding relate to the actual art?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many languages do you know?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is coding worth it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make any video games?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you animate?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where is a good college to find a job?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the most flexible code language?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did you get into programming?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you programmed any games, and how stressing is this process? (How much does this take a toll on your mental health?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you mainly do freelance web-design or do you professionally do it?
Do you have any tips for me on how to improve my coding and typing skills?&lt;/li&gt;

The book details Musk’s childhood through his education and successes at Zip2, PayPal, SpaceX, SolarCity, and Tesla. It was was written in 2015 so, unfortunately, there was no mention of Musk shooting his Tesla into space nor his interview with Joe Rogan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite parts of the book were the anecdotes regarding Musk’s approach to business and leadership. One particular story stood out. Musk, upset with the overuse of acronyms within SpaceX, sent his entire team the following email with the subject line “Acronyms Seriously Suck”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a creeping tendency to use made up acronyms at SpaceX. Excessive use of made up acronyms is a significant impediment to communication and keeping communication good as we grow is incredibly important. Individually, a few acronyms here and there may not seem so bad, but if a thousand people are making these up, over time the result will be a huge glossary that we have to issue to new employees. No one can actually remember all these acronyms and people don’t want to seem dumb in a meeting, so they just sit there in ignorance. This is particularly tough on new employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That needs to stop immediately or I will take drastic action - I have given enough warning over the years. Unless an acronym is approved by me, it should not enter the SpaceX glossary. If there is an existing acronym that cannot reasonably be justified, it should be eliminated, as I have requested in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, there should be not “HTS” [horizontal test stand] or “VTS” [vertical test stand] designations for test stands. Those are particularly dumb, as they contain unnecessary words. A “stand” at our test site is obviously a &lt;em&gt;test&lt;/em&gt; stand. VTS-3 is four syllables compared with “Tripod”, which is two, so the bloody acronym version actually takes longer to say than the name!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key test for an acronym is to ask whether it helps or hurts communication. An acronym that most engineers outside of SpaceX already know, such as GUI, is fine to use. It is also ok to make up a few acronyms/contractions every now and again, assuming I have approved them, e.g. MVac and M9 instead of Merlin 1C-Vacuum or Merlin 1C-Sea Level, but those need to be kept to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story is impactful as it is hard to recall a firm I have worked at that did not suffer from rampant abuse of acronyms. I can vividly recall project kick-offs where new acronyms were introduced and various engineers snickering: “oh no, more acronyms”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going forward, I will be taking care to scrutinize the introduction of new acronyms. Especially as I am frequently finding myself working on distributed teams with individuals whose first language is not English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more, acronym abuse is unhelpful to new team members, and is disrespectful when no one takes the time to explain what the acronyms stand for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, acronym use should be limited - if not totally eliminated - when writing technical requirements where language should be unequivocally clear.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[On Culture]]></title><description><![CDATA[In a recent discussion between Ben Horowitz and Tim Ferris, Horowitz, promoting his new book, What You Do Is Who You Are, notes that:A…]]></description><link>http://chandlermoisen.com/on-culture/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://chandlermoisen.com/on-culture/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 02 Nov 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In a recent discussion between &lt;a href=&quot;https://tim.blog/2019/10/24/ben-horowitz/&quot;&gt;Ben Horowitz and Tim Ferris&lt;/a&gt;, Horowitz, promoting his new book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/What-You-Do-Who-Are/dp/0062871331/&quot;&gt;What You Do Is Who You Are&lt;/a&gt;, notes that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A culture is not a set of beliefs, it’s a set of actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Culture is paramount in startups - and not just to founders. Employees at early-stage firms are both attempting to dent the universe through their work and seeking to shape the culture that enables this work. The work reinforces the culture which inturn reinforces the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Culture becomes a force that gives meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, founders should take heed while embarking on retreats to discover (or rediscover) the values of their firms. When company culture becomes a few paragraphs within a Google Doc that no one can find it is certain that the values comprising the culture will be forgotten or mocked. One of the core responsibilities of leadership is to ensure that culture is first-class citizen and that it drives action, not belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horowitz goes on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you talk it, and don’t do it, then your culture becomes your hypocrisy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than anyone, leader’s actions are scrutinized under a microscope. Seemingly trivial behaviors contrary to the values employees are buying into have an outsized demoralizing impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again: culture is paramount to startup employees. If cultural values are not honored by leadership, will employees continue to buy into leadership’s vision?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Own Your Mistakes]]></title><description><![CDATA[I rely on Pigeon to navigate the mess that is the New York City Subway.You can think of Pigeon as the New York City Subway’s Waze.

&lt;p&gt;You can think of Pigeon as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/31/17414330/google-area-120-pigeon-nyc-subway-app&quot;&gt;New York City Subway’s Waze&lt;/a&gt;. Sprouting from an incubator within Google, Pigeon crowdsources train alerts and notifies users when the subway lines they commute on are experiencing delays.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pigeon sent me a notification that they had messed up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owning your mistakes - especially for something as insignificant as not sending a few mobile notifications - is not a pattern I see all that often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What comes to mind is more &lt;em&gt;forced&lt;/em&gt; corporate responsibility around product safety and PII breaches:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equifax forced to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/equifax-data-breach&quot;&gt;notify the authorities&lt;/a&gt; about a massive data breach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple forced to &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/15-inch-macbook-pro-battery-recall&quot;&gt;recall their 15-inch Macbook Pro&lt;/a&gt; due to battery fires&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook’s forced to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4zd7X98eOs&quot;&gt;apologize for privacy concerns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you could make the argument that Apple is taking active measures to ensure customer safety, both Equifax’s and Facebook’s ownership of mistakes come off as disingenuous and with misplaced intention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pigeon’s product team took a gamble with owning their notification bug. From my perspective, their ownership endears me to their product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will be on the look out for the pattern of owning one’s mistakes elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[OMNY Release, Risks, and UX Considerations]]></title><description><![CDATA[For those of us in the center of the universe, the New York City MTA has finally unveiled support for contactless payments.Long awaited…]]></description><link>http://chandlermoisen.com/omny-release-and-risks/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://chandlermoisen.com/omny-release-and-risks/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For those of us in the center of the universe, the New York City MTA has finally unveiled &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/31/nycs-contactless-subway-turnstiles-open-today-with-apple-google-samsung-and-fitbit-pay-support/&quot;&gt;support for contactless payments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long awaited - Chicago has had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ventrachicago.com/&quot;&gt;contactless payment since 2013&lt;/a&gt; - the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://new.mta.info/system_modernization/omny&quot;&gt;OMNY&lt;/a&gt; (One Metro New York) payment system went live last Friday across select transit lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the sheer scale of the MTA’s infrastructure and the number of customers it serves, there are a number of learnings to be had from how the MTA is releasing OMNY to the general public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Phased Approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to how the MTA overhauled its payment system from 1992 to 2003 as it migrated from tokens to magnetic stripe cards, OMNY is expected to be implemented in phases and not complete until 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes sense as retooling the entire system and enabling it all at once would be prime for disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Witness the embarrassment Chicago suffered when it took this very approach with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2013-12-30-chi-ventra-failures-cost-cta-12-million-in-free-rides-20131230-story.html&quot;&gt;launch of its contactless payment system, Ventra&lt;/a&gt;. A computer issue knocked a considerable number of card readers offline and roughly &lt;strong&gt;one million&lt;/strong&gt; rides were given away during the first weeks after launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Chicago failed to adequately prepare its citizens for the update:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands of Chicago Card customers did not receive Ventra cards in the mail, and many of those who did either didn’t receive activation instructions via email or they misplaced the emails in the long span between receiving the emails and their Ventra cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even worse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myriad other problems followed, including customers being double-charged for rides using Ventra cards; deposits to Ventra accounts failing to be properly credited; and Ventra card readers deducting fares from other contactless cards in riders’ wallets or purses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the MTA has been able to learn from Chicago’s mistakes and is rolling OMNY out much like you’d expect enterprise software to be released:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small, internal test with a few dozen workers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slightly larger, still internal test with 1,500 workers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amny.com/transit/metrocard-replacement-omny-1.29297988&quot;&gt;“Deliberatley small”&lt;/a&gt; public pilot at just a few stations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A customer support team has been set up at 511 to handle OMNY-related questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;OMNY Risks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also interesting to see what risks the MTA has called out surrounding the OMNY release:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond addressing out salient technical issues, many kudos to the MTA for having a bullet point dedicated to “Customer experience” and that they are actively working to address something as difficult as “Changing customer habits and expectations”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other UX Considerations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few other UX considerations the MTA should consider while it continues to release OMNY:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fare Evasion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as the magnetic stripe cards put an end to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/07/nyregion/youths-stealing-subway-tokens-by-sucking-on-turnstile-slots.html&quot;&gt;token sucking&lt;/a&gt;, how will contactless payments impact fare evasion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- &gt; Cubic’s contactless reader can decide whether to let a rider through in 500 milliseconds, according to Brunner. That’s nearly as fast as the blink of an eye, or a heartbeat. The seamlessness of contactless pay will hopefully reduce fare evasion, as well. “People say they jump the turnstile because they swipe the card, realize they don’t have enough fare, and the train’s coming,” said Brunner. “Now that you can pay with your credit card, there’s no problem of ‘Oh, I don’t have any fare, I need to go back to the booth.’” --&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;“Swipe it forward”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riders with unlimited weekly/monthly passes have been encouraged to “swipe it forward” for low-income residents when exiting the station - will this practice continue?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Vanity Cards&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly: as the magnetic stripe cards are phased out, we will also loose out on hustling for vanity cards:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no way to flex with contactless payments…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- ## Initial Response --&gt;
&lt;!-- * https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-omny-data-first-weekend-20190603-75yetlc5dbevlhhri4c3ypr2wy-story.html
* The average time for a tap to register at a turnstile was a half-second
* Fewer than 5% of riders had to tap twice to get through. As riders get used to tapping instead of swiping MetroCards, the number of double taps will fall, the MTA expects.
* Unexpected source of data: &quot;It appears to be popular with tourists — an MTA spokesman said the agency tracked taps by riders from Europe, South America, the Middle East and Asia.&quot;
* Follow up to data: https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/11/nyregion/what-galls-a-hacker-most-the-metrocard.html?mtrref=undefined --&gt;
&lt;!-- * Pretax transit benefits?
&gt; Meanwhile, commuters who sign up for pretax transit benefit programs through their employers learned that the information provided to Ventra isn&apos;t secure. Human resources administrators who tried to log in to their company&apos;s account kept getting other companies&apos; pages.
* Allow users to use the same payment method across all transit options - subway, rail, or bus
* Fare-capping policies? Impact on weekly / monthly fares? Sydney&apos;s Opal card removed their weekly option, London&apos;s oyster card, too --&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[20 Years of Product Management in 25 Minutes]]></title><description><![CDATA[If you have 25 minutes to spare, I highly recommend watching Dave Wascha’s 20 Years of Product Management in 25 Minutes.Wascha is the…]]></description><link>http://chandlermoisen.com/20-years-of-product-management-in-25-minutes/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://chandlermoisen.com/20-years-of-product-management-in-25-minutes/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jun 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;If you have 25 minutes to spare, I highly recommend watching Dave Wascha’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69U0lvi89c&amp;#x26;feature=share&quot;&gt;20 Years of Product Management in 25 Minutes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wascha is the current CPO at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.photobox.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Photo Box&lt;/a&gt; and began his career as the product manager for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_4&quot;&gt;IE 4.0&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His talk, geared towards product managers but applicable to all disciplines across the product organization, encapsulates his learnings from 20 years of successes and failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of personal learnings from it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Listen To Customers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The PM’s responsibility is to be “manically focused on customer problems”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cannot solve the customers problem without understanding it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cannot understand the problem if you do not listen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you don’t listen to your customers, you build solutions to problems that no one has&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don’t Listen to Customers (when it comes to solutions)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customers are the least qualified people to come up with solutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Watch the Competition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The competition is a rich source of information to understand customer issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each new feature the competition ships should be viewed as a user test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don’t Watch the Competition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is implementing a new trend / technology really help my customers solve their problem?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Be a Thief&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PM’s do not have to come up with all the ideas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your job is to solve customer problems - if the competition has a great solution - steal it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Get Paid&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most PM’s work in commercial endeavors - a lot of time is spent brining features to market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forgot to ask if people will actually pay for what we have built&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the customer’s willingness to pay for a solution?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People need to see enough value in what you are building to pay for it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PM’s need to solve their customers’ problems - not their company’s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stop Worrying About Getting Paid&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Business-casing the soul out of our products”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forced to justify every change and idea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slows velocity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Creates a culture of systematic risk aversion”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Creates a culture of small incremental thinking driving small incremental gains”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No longer enough  to appeal to just the functional needs of customers - also need to appeal to emotional and social needs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customers want a relationship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customers want to believe that we have their best interest at heart&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not all features need to be justified by ROI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Speed Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need to consider the “cost of delay”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much value is lost by not taking action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everytime a decision is put off, you are destroying value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Products have a limited shelf-life - the longer it takes them to get to market the less value they have&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Say, “No”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of stake holders, competingting priorities, lots of people to make happy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only the customer’s demands should matter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don’t say no for the wrong reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protecting the team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t like the person&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure you are saying no for the right reasons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don’t Be A Visionary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Products don’t need visionaries they need product managers who are obsessed with understanding the customer’s problem and solving it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don’t Confuse Yourself with Your Customer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A product manager that thinks they really know their customer is like a male gynocologist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Be Dumb&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have a precious gift when you are starting off. You are not encumbered by knowledge and you are not encumbered by inertia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Best PM’s have a capacity to be dumb - to always look at a situation through the eyes of a customer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies drift and lose sight of mission and begin solving their problems, not their customers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Customer Problems vs. Business Problems]]></title><description><![CDATA[A notable takeaway from Dave Wascha’s 20 Years of Product Management in 25 Minutes is that companies often loose sight of their own mission…]]></description><link>http://chandlermoisen.com/customer-problems-vs-business-problems/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://chandlermoisen.com/customer-problems-vs-business-problems/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jun 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A notable takeaway from Dave Wascha’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69U0lvi89c&amp;#x26;feature=share&quot;&gt;20 Years of Product Management in 25 Minutes&lt;/a&gt; is that companies often loose sight of their own mission and begin solving their own problems instead of solving their customers’ problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the responsibility of the product organization to prevent such drift - to fight for the customer and ensure their problems are prioritized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there will always be a balance between stakeholders, customers should never take a back seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What follows is an example of a firm prioritizing their own problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bespoke Post&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year I signed up for &lt;a href=&quot;https://bespokepost.com&quot;&gt;Bespoke Post&lt;/a&gt; - a Birchbox-esque play aimed at men with an extra $60 to spend each month.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It differs from Birchbox in that it gives the user more control over what they receive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of each month, users are offered an array of boxes to choose from. If nothing catches the user’s eye, they can opt-out of receiving a box that month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bespoke does pre-select a box for the user and gives them roughly a week to make a change or cancel the order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This model can prove dangerous to users who are busy (in my case, forgetful) and do not cancel unwanted boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was able to snag a few records, a nice brass pen, and an over-the-top &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statgeartools.com/pocket-samurai-keychain-knife-aluminum-edition/&quot;&gt;Pocket Samurai Keychain Knife&lt;/a&gt;, I forgot to cancel an order and ended up with a pair of rather unimpressive sunglasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bespoke Post does offer free returns, but only for store-credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This minor lapse in my memory, the difficulty in making the return, and the ugly sunglasses spurred some personal financial responsibility and I set out to cancel my subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cancellation Difficulties&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a place in hell for firms that make it difficult for their users to cancel their service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an understandable need for businesses to reduce churn and product teams should take all necessary measures to do so. That said, making it difficult for users to cancel your product should not be considered one of these measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firms that subscribe to such a tactic are solving their own problems instead of their customers’ problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what I had to go through to cancel my Bespoke Post account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at Bespoke’s user dashboard, you will see there is no obvious method to cancel:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to click through each menu option - “Account”, “Profile”, etc. - multiple times before I finally gave up and decided to check the “FAQ” at the bottom of the page:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is right: I had to send a “pre-formatted email” to the Bespoke team informing them &lt;em&gt;in writing&lt;/em&gt; of my intent to cancel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will spare you the entirety of the email thread, but, as expected, this was not the only email I would have to send in order to cancel my subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the entire workflow for cancelling my Bespoke Post account:&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So. Much. Friction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me 12 steps (actually more considering I had to revisit GMail multiple times) and three days, but I was finally able to cancel the subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, Bespoke Post does not provide an intuitive UI encouraging me to restart my subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Outcome&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This stands as a case-study of solving your business problems instead of your customer problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I understand Bespoke’s need to reduce churn, but creating such a high level of friction in their UX does not help their customers. Such a strategy has an off-putting effect and makes it quite clear that Bespoke is putting their own interests in front of their customers’ needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an alternative, Bespoke Post should make the cancellation process as smooth as possible and then weigh following up with re-targeting, reasons-for-churn survey, etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I would be very curious to see an analysis between their current cancellation path and another path with less friction: one that allows users to easily cancel their subscription from within the UI (sans email thread with customer support).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would imagine that Bespoke’s target users are not hurting for the $60/month fee and that they value the random box of materials good each month over the level of effort required to cancel.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How To Be Empty]]></title><description><![CDATA[In an effort to bring order to the chaos that is transferring medical records between doctors, I recently signed up for Galileo Health…]]></description><link>http://chandlermoisen.com/how-to-be-empty/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://chandlermoisen.com/how-to-be-empty/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 29 May 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In an effort to bring order to the chaos that is transferring medical records between doctors, I recently signed up for &lt;a href=&quot;https://galileohealth.com/&quot;&gt;Galileo Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Purporting to simplify management of personal electronic health records, Galileo also helps users schedule simple check-ups, renew prescriptions (that are not controlled substances), request lab work, and other tedious personal health tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overlooking Emptiness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Galileo application has a nice user experience overall, the search functionality leaves a bit to be desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the result of searching for the NYU Langone hospital system:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a nebulous empty-state containing the text: &lt;em&gt;Search for “NYU Langone”&lt;/em&gt; - an action which I believed had just occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galileo can be forgiven for not having every single doctor and hospital available on their platform, but they should be taking advantage of this empty-state to give the user better feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This got me curious to how other products display empty search results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Art of Being Empty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Clear Copy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very least, users need an unequivocal response that their search has not returned any results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developer-focused blogging platform &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.to&quot;&gt;dev.to&lt;/a&gt; does this well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Simple Suggestions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even better, add some light copy to encourage the user to try different approaches to their search as we see with &lt;a href=&quot;https://spotify.com&quot;&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Actionable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite empty-state is &lt;a href=&quot;https://amazon.com&quot;&gt;Amazon’s e-commerce search results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only is the user provided with clear copy and simple suggestions on how to alter their search, but Amazon also affords the user the opportunity to provide valuable feedback:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Curiosity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week I listened to Tyler McGinnis’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://tylermcginnis.com/podcast/dan-abramov/&quot;&gt;podcast interview&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@dan_abramov&quot;&gt;Dan Abramov&lt;/a&gt; - creator of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reactjs/redux&quot;&gt;Redux&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://egghead.io/instructors/dan-abramov&quot;&gt;educator&lt;/a&gt;, and professional open-sourcer at Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my main takeaways was Abramov’s level of curiosity and how it lead him to rework &lt;a href=&quot;http://facebook.github.io/flux/&quot;&gt;Facebook’s Flux&lt;/a&gt; into Redux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiosity is an important trait for any developer, but the level of abstraction in modern JavaScript development - the focus on frameworks and libraries vs. the core language -  makes it easy to take functioning code for granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is almost too easy to fall into this way of thinking - taking patterns, frameworks, build tools, etc. at their face value - especially when your primary responsibility as a developer in industry is to ship features. Between management and customer demands, coordination across teams, putting out fires from legacy code, and figuring out how to configure Webpack, you don’t always have the energy, or time, to wonder why a library works the way it does - that the library solves your immediate problem is good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously this is not ideal - you should know why your tools behave the way they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as a challenge, follow Abramov’s lead: embrace curiosity and challenge yourself to better understand the tools you take for granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am starting off easy: why do we have to to import React into every component?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why JSX Requires React in Scope&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve worked in React, you’ve undoubtedly come across the following ESLint error while working in JSX files:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;React&amp;#39; must be in scope when using JSX (react/react-in-jsx-scope)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This error is easily resolved by importing React into the module:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; React &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;react&apos;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;MyComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;title&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; MyComponent&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why import React at all? It’s not like we are actually referring to React anywhere inside of this compoent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right…?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, we are; running the above component through &lt;a href=&quot;https://babeljs.io/repl/&quot;&gt;Babel’s REPL&lt;/a&gt; returns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;React&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;h1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; className&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;title&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello, World!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, if we fail to import React when using JSX, we end up referring to an object that does not exist in scope: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;React.createElement&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be tempted to make React accessible from the global scope. While this will save you a few keystrokes in each React component, it might not be the ideal strategy as the overall JavaScript community appears to be shying away from using global variables in favor of local, explicitly declared dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy JavaScripting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[JS Class Fields Proposal Stage 3 Update, BabelJS, and Airbnb's JS Style Guide]]></title><description><![CDATA[In case you haven’t heard the news, Daniel Ehrenberg and Jeff Morrison’s ESnext class features for JavaScript proposal was moved from stage…]]></description><link>http://chandlermoisen.com/js-class-fields-proposal-at-stage-3/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://chandlermoisen.com/js-class-fields-proposal-at-stage-3/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 02 Sep 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a

&lt;p&gt;In case you haven’t heard the news, Daniel Ehrenberg and Jeff Morrison’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields&quot;&gt;ESnext class features for JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; proposal was moved from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields/commit/5a4ff5fa4bf30885188279f6fb8070f2e1903c32&quot;&gt;stage-2 to stage-3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is especially great news for anyone who has been using BabelJS’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-class-properties/&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;transform-class-properties&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; plugin, as we no longer have to worry about the proposal dropping and the crises of conscious that would haunt us as we debate brining our React components back in line with standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are unfamilar with React and ES6+ class properties, check out this &lt;a href=&quot;https://babeljs.io/blog/2015/06/07/react-on-es6-plus&quot;&gt;fantastic article&lt;/a&gt; noting some of the highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tl;dr - we go from this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;	&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; MyComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; React&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		propTypes&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;getDefaultProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;getInitialState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;	&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; MyComponent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; React&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Component &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  		&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; propTypes &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
	  	&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; defaultProps &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
		state &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, even as we all eagerly await BabelJS’s maintainers to move &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;transform-class-properties&lt;/code&gt; from the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;stage-2&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;stage-3&lt;/code&gt; preset, if you are using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/airbnb/javascript&quot;&gt;Airbnb’s JavaScript Style Guide&lt;/a&gt;, you will have to wait a little longer until your linter stops yelling at you for using class properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ljharb&quot;&gt;Jordan Harband&lt;/a&gt;, dev at Airbnb, states that we can use the new feature&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/1521#issuecomment-322267012&quot;&gt;“as soon as eslint core supports it - sadly they aren’t likely to do so until stage 4.”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bummer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, like me, you simply cannot write React components without the new JS class properties, but rely on Jordan and team rest of the team at Airbnb to keep your JS in check, have no fear - a workaround does exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply add the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;babel-eslint&lt;/code&gt; parser - this allows you to use all valid Babel code, even that which might not be supported by ESLint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once installed, updated your &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.eslintrc&lt;/code&gt; file with the new parser:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;json&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;	&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;extends&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;airbnb&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;parser&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;babel-eslint&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy JavaScripting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Roll Your Own Static Site]]></title><description><![CDATA[rolling on fridayRecently I decided to rebuild my long neglected and dilapidated blog - previously powered by Octopress - using JavaScript…]]></description><link>http://chandlermoisen.com/roll-your-own-static-site/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://chandlermoisen.com/roll-your-own-static-site/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2017 22:12:03 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/rolling-054ca163e31520d2625820020aa4870a.gif&quot; alt=&quot;rolling on friday&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I decided to rebuild my long neglected and dilapidated blog - previously powered by &lt;a href=&quot;http://octopress.org/&quot;&gt;Octopress&lt;/a&gt; - using JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a blog is a perfect use case for a static site generator, I first investigated existing solutions, and found, as expected, there are already quite a few available:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.metalsmith.io/&quot;&gt;Metalsmith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hexo.io/&quot;&gt;Hexo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wintersmith.io/&quot;&gt;Wintersmith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.staticgen.com/&quot;&gt;https://www.staticgen.com/&lt;/a&gt; for even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While more than sufficient, I found these to be overkill as all I really needed was to &lt;strong&gt;convert some markdown into HTML&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add a pinch of CSS, maybe your favorite frontend view layer, and that’s it - you’re cruising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as any self-respecting dev would do, I rolled my own with React - check it out &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cheshireoctopus/cheshireoctopus.github.io&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Structure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structure (simplified below) is pretty straight-forward:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;|-- app
|	|-- components
|	|-- index.js
|	|-- posts.json
|	|-- projects.json
|-- bin
|	|-- gen
|-- public
|	|-- blog
|		|-- my_first_post
|			|-- img
|			|-- data.json
|			|-- post.md
|-- index.html
|-- webpack.confg.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;app/components/&lt;/code&gt; holds all the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.jsx&lt;/code&gt;, and uses &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;posts.json&lt;/code&gt; - created via &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bin/gen&lt;/code&gt; (see below) - to populate the blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blog posts are stored as individual directories in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;public/blog/&lt;/code&gt;; each post directory contains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;post.md&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;img/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data.json&lt;/code&gt; contains post-specific metadata (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;title&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;date&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;topics&lt;/code&gt;), while &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;post.md&lt;/code&gt; contains the related markdown content; &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;img/&lt;/code&gt; holds the post’s images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See an example &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cheshireoctopus/cheshireoctopus.github.io/tree/master/public/blog/twilio_on_rails_sms_basics&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;./bin/gen&lt;/code&gt; from root parses through each post directory in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;public/blog/&lt;/code&gt;, transforms the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;post.md&lt;/code&gt; file into HTML, and then adds this string under the key &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;html&lt;/code&gt; to the relative &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data.json&lt;/code&gt; object. Each JSON object is then pushed to an array and outputted at &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;app/posts.json&lt;/code&gt; for use inside the React app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Markdown to HTML&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core of the blog is powered by a single shell script that rips through a bunch of markdown files, converting them into HTML:&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bluebird’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.promisifyAll&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick note: asynchronous file input/output can quickly lead to a labyrinth of callbacks. To help mitigate sphagetti code, you’ll see that I leveraged &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Bluebird.promisifyAll&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/api/promise.promisifyall.html&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;) by wrapping Node’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;fs&lt;/code&gt; module:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; Promise &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;bluebird&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; fs &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Promise&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;promisifyAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;fs&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.promisifyAll&lt;/code&gt; parses through an object, “promisifying” the object’s methods. These new promises are accessed via the original method’s name + a suffix of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Async&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, to read a directory using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;fs&lt;/code&gt;, one would typically call &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;fs.readdir&lt;/code&gt;; when wrapped using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;promisifyAll&lt;/code&gt; one would call &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;fs.readdirAsync&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Marked: Custom Parsers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To convert markdown into HTML, I relied upon &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chjj/marked&quot;&gt;marked&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://highlightjs.org/&quot;&gt;highlight.js&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While marked will convert markdown to HTML out of the box, it does require custom configuration when rendering code blocks and applying syntax highlighting. Thankfully, this process is pretty easy, thanks to hightlight.js.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of marked’s configuration can be accessed via its &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chjj/marked#renderer&quot;&gt;marked.Renderer()&lt;/a&gt; API. This allows the developer to define functions which are invoked when parsing certain &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chjj/marked#block-level-renderer-methods&quot;&gt;block&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chjj/marked#inline-level-renderer-methods&quot;&gt;inline&lt;/a&gt; elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, to apply custom markup to an image element, first instantiate a new &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Renderer()&lt;/code&gt; object, define an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;image&lt;/code&gt; method on this object describing what HTML should returned when parsing an image, and finally use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.setOptions&lt;/code&gt; to apply the custom rendering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; marked &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;marked&apos;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; renderer &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;marked&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Renderer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

renderer&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;image&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;src&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; title&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; alt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`&amp;lt;div class=&quot;post-image-container&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;img src=&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;src&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot; alt=&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;alt&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;/&gt;&amp;lt;/div&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

marked&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setOptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	renderer&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying custom rendering to a code block would be similar, except you would utilize hightlight.js to apply syntax highlighting. Check out this &lt;a href=&quot;http://shuheikagawa.com/blog/2015/09/21/using-highlight-js-with-marked/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; for some more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; marked &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;marked&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; highlightjs &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;highlight.js&apos;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; renderer &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;marked&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Renderer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

renderer&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;code&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; language&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`&amp;lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;code class=&quot;hljs &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;language&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;highlighted&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/code&gt;&amp;lt;/pre&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

marked&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setOptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One caveat when hightlight.js - it does not ship with line numbers in code blocks. According to the library’s author(s), this is &lt;a href=&quot;http://highlightjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/line-numbers.html&quot;&gt;“not an oversight but a feature”&lt;/a&gt;, and it does appear that a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wcoder/highlightjs-line-numbers.js/&quot;&gt;plugin&lt;/a&gt; was built to add them in.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[MailChimp, Gibbon, and Rails - Basic Mailing List Setup]]></title><description><![CDATA[You’ve made it to the big time when you want to start a mailing list.

  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve made it to the big time when you want to start a mailing list. There are many ESP’s (email service providers) out there, each with respective strengths and weaknesses. I’d recommend checking into &lt;a href=&quot;https://mailchimp.com/&quot;&gt;MailChimp&lt;/a&gt; as they provide an “entrepreneur’s plan” that allows you to send 12,000 emails a month to 2,000 subscribers – &lt;strong&gt;for free, for life.&lt;/strong&gt; And because I have no experience with any other ESP…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will cover MailChimp’s integration with Rails using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/amro/gibbon&quot;&gt;Gibbon&lt;/a&gt; gem. We will be building a simple Rails application that will display a form to collects users’ email addresses and add them to a MailChimp email list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is assumed that you possess a basic/intermediate understanding of Ruby (v. 1.9.3) and Rails (v. 4.0.2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; this tutorial covers MailChimp’s V2 of their API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Part One: MailChimp&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we jump into Rails, we need to do three things: 1) obtain our API key, 2) make an email list with MailChimp; 3) obtain that list’s ID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1)&lt;/strong&gt; Once logged into your MailChimp account, look to the left, select your name, and then “Account Settings” in the popup menu. Next, click the “Extras” dropdown and select “API Keys”. Voilla, you have your API key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2)&lt;/strong&gt; To generate an email list, select “Lists” from the menu on the left. In the top-right corner, click “Create List” to begin the process. Hint: it’s relatively straight forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3)&lt;/strong&gt; To get the ID of the list you just created, select “List” from the menu on the left. This displays a list of lists…Click on the name of your new list, then the “Settings” dropdown, and select “List name &amp;#x26; defaults”. Now you have your list ID. Super.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Part Two: Rails&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rails integration involves five steps: 1) adding the Gibbon gem to your gemfile; 2) creating an intializer file; 3) generating a controller and 4) a view; and 5) configuring your routes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1)&lt;/strong&gt; Add the Gibbon gem to your gemfile and run bundle in your terminal. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/amro/gibbon&quot;&gt;Gibbon is an API wrapper for MailChimp’s Primary and Export APIs&lt;/a&gt;, or, in other words, a chunk of code you can drop into your project and work with quickly. There are quite a few MailChimp API Wrappers spanning a variety of languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;#Gemfile&lt;/span&gt;

gem &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;gibbon&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; git&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;git://github.co/amro/gibbon.git&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take note: other &lt;a href=&quot;http://mrgeorgegray.com/workflow/getting-a-grip-on-gibbon/&quot;&gt;tutorials&lt;/a&gt; reported issues running the correct version of the gem. If you encounter a similar problem, try adding &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;git: ‘git://github.co/amro/gibbon.git’&lt;/code&gt; to your gemfile so it points to the gem’s repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2)&lt;/strong&gt; Create a new initializer file, ‘gibbon.rb’, in ‘config/initializers’ to declare your MailChimp API key and two other variables. Setting throws_exception to false will give you a pretty hash in the event of an error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;#config/initializers/gibbon.rb&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;Gibbon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;api_key &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;YOUR-API-KEY&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;Gibbon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;timeout &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;Gibbon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;throws_exceptions &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3)&lt;/strong&gt; Generate a controller &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;emailapi&lt;/code&gt; to handle MailChimp’s API calls and create a method &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;subscribe&lt;/code&gt; that will be responsible for taking users’ email input and pushing it to your mailing list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;#app/controllers/emailapi_controller.rb&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token method-definition&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token method-definition&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;subscribe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@list_id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;YOUR-LIST-ID&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    gb &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;Gibbon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;gb&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;lists&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;subscribe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token symbol&quot;&gt;:id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@list_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token symbol&quot;&gt;:email&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token symbol&quot;&gt;:email&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; params&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token symbol&quot;&gt;:email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token symbol&quot;&gt;:address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The variables &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;@list_id&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gb&lt;/code&gt; are respectively defined as the ID of the list you created (from Part One, remember?) and an instance of the API wrapper. The latter is pulling from the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;app/config/initializers/gibbon.rb&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we make an API call – &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.lists.subscribe()&lt;/code&gt; – on the instance itself. This call takes a hash as an argument, and in this hash, we pass two parameters: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;:id&lt;/code&gt;, associated with the ID of your list, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;:email&lt;/code&gt;, associated with the user’s email (this will become clearer after we construct the view).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4)&lt;/strong&gt; Having completed the controller, let’s make the corresponding view. Create a file &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;index.html.erb&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;/app/views/emailapi&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;#app/views/emailapi/index.html.erb&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;Get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;My&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;Awesome&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;News&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;Letter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;Give&lt;/span&gt; me your email &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; keep up to date on my cat&apos;s thoughts&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;%= form_tag(&apos;/emailapi/subscribe&apos;, method: &quot;post&quot;, id: &quot;subscribe&quot;, remote: &quot;true&quot;) do -%&gt;
   &amp;lt;%=&lt;/span&gt; email_field&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token symbol&quot;&gt;:email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token symbol&quot;&gt;:address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;id&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;email&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; placeholder&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;email address&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;%&gt;
   &amp;lt;%= submit_tag(&quot;Sign me up!&quot;) %&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beneath the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; html elements, use a Rails helper &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;form_tag&lt;/code&gt; to create the sign up form. Pass in four paramaters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The action the form is going to take, or where the form will be submitted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The HTML method defining how the action will occur, in this case &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;post&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The form’s ID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;remote&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, allowing unobtrusive JS drivers to modify the the form’s behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastl, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;submit_tag&lt;/code&gt; method creates our &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags. Our form is rendered in HTML as seen below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Get My Awesome News Letter&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Give me your email and keep up to date on my cat&apos;s thoughts.&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;accept-charset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;UTF-8&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;/emailapi/subscribe&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;data-remote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;true&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;subscribe&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;method&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;post&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token style-attr language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;#config/routes.rb&lt;/span&gt;

root &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;emailapi#index&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
post &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;emailapi/subscribe&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;emailapi#subscribe&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, you should be good to go. Keep in mind, this tutorial barely scratches the surface of MailChimp + Rails + Gibbon.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twilio on Rails - SMS Basics]]></title><description><![CDATA[Twilio is an awesome platform that makes it super easy to add SMS, voice, and VOIP functionality to your web applications.This tutorial will…]]></description><link>http://chandlermoisen.com/twilio-on-rails-sms-basics/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://chandlermoisen.com/twilio-on-rails-sms-basics/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2013 22:12:03 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twilio.com/&quot;&gt;Twilio&lt;/a&gt; is an awesome platform that makes it super easy to add SMS, voice, and VOIP functionality to your web applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will show you how to set up an extremely simple Ruby on Rails application that uses Twilio to send SMS messages from your browser. It’s probably best that you have a basic understanding of RoR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Twilio Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio&quot;&gt;Sign up&lt;/a&gt; for free using a telephone number that you have access to – preferably your cell – as you will have to verify your account via SMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2:&lt;/strong&gt; Twilio will automatically generate a telephone number for you. In my experience, these generated numbers are issued with the same area code as the original number you signed up with. &lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; you can customize your number if you so wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you’ve made it through the login, you should be welcomed with this screen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make a note of both the &lt;strong&gt;ACCOUNT SID&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;AUTH TOKEN&lt;/strong&gt; – you will need both of these later. To see the latter, click on the lock to view it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3:&lt;/strong&gt; I like to save my Twilio numbers in my cell because I have a terrible memory. As you can guess, I often forget to do even that. Visiting the ‘Numbers’ pane on the Twilio dashboard – pictured below – provide them for you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rails Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:&lt;/strong&gt; First, create the Rails application, in this case thought-provokingly named ‘twilio_app’. We don’t need the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; that Rails so graciously provides – toss it, you don’t need that noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;#bash&lt;/span&gt;

$ rails new twilio_app
$ &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;rm&lt;/span&gt; public/index.html&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2:&lt;/strong&gt; Twilio compiled a gem which makes Rails integration realtively painless. Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://twilio-ruby.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; and add it in the Gemfile. Make sure to bundle!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;#Gemfile&lt;/span&gt;

gem &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;twilio-ruby&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3:&lt;/strong&gt; Next, we will generate a controller which will be responsbile for making sense of our app’s requests and producing the appropriate output. &lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; this method of controller generation creates a bunch of extra files you do not need for this application, but it’s easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;#bash&lt;/span&gt;

$ rails g controller twilio&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4:&lt;/strong&gt; In the controller you just created, add a method &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;send_sms&lt;/code&gt; which will send the SMS’s. We will come back to this in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;#twilio_controller.rb&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;TwilioController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;ApplicationController&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token method-definition&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;send_sms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5:&lt;/strong&gt; We’re making headway on the backend, but we need do some barebones frontend functionality. Create a file &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;index.html.erb&lt;/code&gt; that your Twilio controller has access to. Make sure this file is located in the following directory: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;twilio_app/app/views/layouts&lt;/code&gt;. In this file we are going to create a simple form which will allow the user to input a phone number and a message. Make sure the form’s action directs to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;/send_sms&lt;/code&gt; and the method is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# index.html.erb %&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;TWILIO!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;%= form_tag(&apos;/send_sms&apos;, method: &apos;POST&apos;) do %&gt;
	&amp;lt;input type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;text&quot;&lt;/span&gt; placeholder&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;enter number&quot;&lt;/span&gt; name&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;number&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;input type&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;text&quot;&lt;/span&gt; placeholder&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;enter message here&quot;&lt;/span&gt; name&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;message&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;button type&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;submit&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;Submit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;index.html.erb&lt;/code&gt; should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6:&lt;/strong&gt; Now that we’ve made our view and controller, let’s connect them via &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;routes.rb&lt;/code&gt;. Clear out the comments in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;routes.rb&lt;/code&gt; file, build a root path that directs to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;index.html.erb&lt;/code&gt;, and then another path that will post the information from the form we just built to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;send_sms&lt;/code&gt; method in the Twilio controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;#routes.rb&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;TwilioApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;Application&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;routes&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;draw &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;

  root &lt;span class=&quot;token symbol&quot;&gt;:to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;twilio#index&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
  post &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;/send_sms&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;twilio#send_sms&apos;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7:&lt;/strong&gt; Alright, last step. Do you still remember your &lt;strong&gt;ACCOUNT SID&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;AUTH TOKEN&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Twilio phone number&lt;/strong&gt;? We’re going to add these to our Twilio controller’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;send_sms&lt;/code&gt; method to enable our application to send texts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll show you my code, then walk you through it line by line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;#twilio_controller.rb&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;TwilioController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;ApplicationController&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token method-definition&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;send_sms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		message &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; params&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token symbol&quot;&gt;:message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
		number &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; params&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token symbol&quot;&gt;:number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
		account_sid &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;XXXyour account sid should be hereXXX&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
		auth_token &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;XXXyour auth token should be hereXXX&apos;&lt;/span&gt;

		&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@client&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;Twilio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;REST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;Client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;account_sid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; auth_token
		&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;account&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;messages&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;create&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;token symbol&quot;&gt;:to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;+1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token delimiter tag&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;number&lt;span class=&quot;token delimiter tag&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;token symbol&quot;&gt;:from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;+12813308004&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;token symbol&quot;&gt;:body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token delimiter tag&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;message&lt;span class=&quot;token delimiter tag&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
		redirect_to &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;/&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Line 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Opens the TwilioController&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Line 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Defines the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;send_sms&lt;/code&gt; method&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Line 4:&lt;/strong&gt; Takes the message input from the form in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;index.html.erb&lt;/code&gt; as a paramater and assigns it to the variable ‘message’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Line 5:&lt;/strong&gt; Takes the number input from the form in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;index.html.erb&lt;/code&gt; as a paramater and assigns it to the variable &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;number&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Line 6:&lt;/strong&gt; Stores your &lt;strong&gt;ACCOUNT_SID&lt;/strong&gt; as a variable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Line 7:&lt;/strong&gt; Stores your &lt;strong&gt;AUTH_TOKEN&lt;/strong&gt; as a variable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Line 9:&lt;/strong&gt; Instatiates a Twilio Rest Client as &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;@client&lt;/code&gt;, which stores the authentication parameters on lines 6 and 7 (account&lt;em&gt;sid and auth&lt;/em&gt;token, respectively), and enables the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;send_sms&lt;/code&gt; method to make HTTP request to Twilio. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rubydoc.info/github/twilio/twilio-ruby/Twilio/REST/Client&quot;&gt;More info…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Line 11-13:&lt;/strong&gt; Creates a message, stored as the variable &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;@message&lt;/code&gt;, which takes a hash as an argument. The hash should include: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;:to&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;:from&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;:body&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;:to&lt;/code&gt; interpolates the variable number, and represents the recipeint of the SMS. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;:from&lt;/code&gt; should be your Twilio number stored in the following format: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;+12813308004&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;:body&lt;/code&gt; interpolates the message variable which contains the message entered on &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;index.html.erb&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Line 14:&lt;/strong&gt; After the SMS is processed and sent, this redirects the user back to the root directory, or, in our case, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;index.html.erb&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Outcome&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming the code is correct, run the application locally and send yourself a message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If everything works out, you should be able to send SMS messages from your browser!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Caveats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this application was developed using Twilio’s free service, you can only send texts to the phone number that you verified your Twilio account with. To mess with your friends, activate your Twilio account by adding a credit card. Individual texts cost less than $.01.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day I will write a follow up, but for now, check out this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/crtr0/twilio-rails-demo&quot;&gt;github repo&lt;/a&gt; for an idea of where else you can take Twilio and Rails.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
