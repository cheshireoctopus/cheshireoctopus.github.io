This engineer tells me that a culture where engineers are strongly encouraged and coached on delivering original value is one where an engineer is considered a <em>vertically integrated product team</em>.</p>\n<p>Think about that for a moment: empower and coach your engineers so they are able to solely perform the role of an entire product team. They can identify opportunities, consensus build, manage a project, perform design iterations, and implement features.</p>\n<p>This isn’t to argue that engineers should replace their valuable cross-functional teammates. Rather, enable them to deliver end-to-end on their twenty-percent work as at the end of the day, product engineering is an inherently creative pursuit and product engineers are creative individuals.</p>\n<p>Let their freak flags fly.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Engineers as Vertically Integrated Product Teams","date":"October 22, 2021","isTIL":true}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/engineers-as-vertically-integrated-product-teams/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/what-middle-schoolers-want-to-know-about-programming/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What Middle Schoolers Want to Know About Programming","redirects":null}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/bootcamp-graduates-and-mentorship/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Untraditional Engineering Backgrounds and Mentorship","redirects":null}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["4173562750","63159454"]}
