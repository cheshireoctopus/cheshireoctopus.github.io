Like my relationship with most things, I find remote work manageable in moderation. It’s been on full-blast for nearly six-months.</p>\n<p>Software can certainly be developed by remote teams - see <a href=\"https://basecamp.com/books/remote\">Basecamp</a> - but I personally enjoy the sans-Zoom human:human interaction of cross-disciplinary professionals locking down a meeting room to think about hard problems.</p>\n<p>Further, there is the camaraderie and squad culture that develops when teams meet in person and work in close proximity. All of those insignificant interactions - sharing an elevator ride, cracking jokes about the hole-in-the-wall Korean spot’s menu, complaints about the aforementioned stuffy meeting rooms - they compound overtime. Sure, these do not create culture overnight, but there presence certainly provides part of the foundation.</p>\n<p>I will be embarking on a side quest to create some ceremonies for my immediate squad that seek to be the interactions we can build a legitimate team culture upon. Wish me good luck.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Building (Remote) Team Culture","date":"August 13, 2020","isTIL":true}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/building-remote-team-culture/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/slack-keyword-notifications/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Slack Keyword Notifications","redirects":null}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/discipline-vs-systems/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Discipline vs. Systems","redirects":null}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["4173562750","63159454"]}
