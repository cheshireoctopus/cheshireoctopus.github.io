If you were to simplify one component of the system, you would ultimately end up creating more complexity in another component.</p>\n<p>As an example of this law, I, a product developer, work with designers to simplify user-facing components of software systems. In other words, we remove complexity from the user-facing parts of these systems. This complexity is not banished from the system, however. Instead, this complexity manifest itself elsewhere in the system, most likely in a complicated API or data model.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Tesler's Law","date":"May 11, 2020","isTIL":true}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/teslers-law/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/issues-sharing-a-project/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Challenges Sharing a Project","redirects":["/issues-sharing-a-project"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/neumorphism/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Neumorphism","redirects":null}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["4173562750","63159454"]}
