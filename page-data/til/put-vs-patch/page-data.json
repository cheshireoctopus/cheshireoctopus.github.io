The methods <strong>differ</strong> in the mechanics of how this updating occurs. In other words, a server will process the request body - the enclosed entity - of a <code class=\"language-text\">PUT</code> request different than that of a <code class=\"language-text\">PATCH</code> request.</p>\n<h2>PUT</h2>\n<p>When processing a <code class=\"language-text\">PUT</code> request against a resource, a server will view the body of this request as the <strong>new</strong> resource, essentially overwriting the existing resource.</p>\n<p>Because of this, clients making <code class=\"language-text\">PUT</code> request against a resource must send the <strong>entire</strong> resource to ensure it remains intact.</p>\n<h2>PATCH</h2>\n<p>On the other hand, a server processing a <code class=\"language-text\">PATCH</code> request against a resource, views the body of the request as a <strong>partial</strong> update to the resource. The existing resource is then modified versus being overwritten entirely.</p>\n<p>Clients making <code class=\"language-text\">PATCH</code> requests against a resource must only send the data to update as opposed to the entire resource.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"HTTP PUT vs PATCH","date":"June 03, 2020","isTIL":true}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/put-vs-patch/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/how-to-give-box-shadow-border-radius/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to Give Box Shadow a Border Radius"}},"next":null}}}
