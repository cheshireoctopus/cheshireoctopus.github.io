If you were to simplify one component of the system, you would ultimately end up creating more complexity in another component.</p>\n<p>As an example of this law, I, a product developer, work with designers to simplify user-facing components of software systems. In other words, we remove complexity from the user-facing parts of these systems. This complexity is not banished from the system, however. Instead, this complexity manifest itself elsewhere in the system, most likely in a complicated API or data model.</p>","frontmatter":{"tags":["TIL"],"title":"TIL: Tesler's Law","date":"May 11, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/til-teslers-law/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/til-three-great-virtues-of-a-programmer/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"TIL: Three Great Virtues of a Programmer"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/til-mirage-js/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"TIL: Mirage.js"}}}}}
