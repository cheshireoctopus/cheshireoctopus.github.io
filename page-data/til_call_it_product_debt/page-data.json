Technology is the bank that gave credit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The author of the article is arguing that as the modern development teams are driven by their backlogs and that success is defined as clearing the log. As such, developers who are under pressure to ship end up creating technical debt - a term the author states developers made up “because it sounds better than cutting corners and with the hope it is repaid.”</p>\n<p>What I like about this change in name is that it places the onus of responsibility on product to find the time in the backlog to repay the debt.</p>","frontmatter":{"tags":["TIL"],"title":"TIL: Call it 'Product Debt'","date":"May 06, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/til_call_it_product_debt/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/til_postmortem_questions/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"TIL: Questions For Postmortems"}},"next":null}}}
