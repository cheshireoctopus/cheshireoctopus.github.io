The hypothesis is that those who relied heavily on mentors to learn will want to ensure the same opportunity for others.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Untraditional Engineering Backgrounds and Mentorship","date":"October 26, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/bootcamp-graduates-and-mentorship/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/engineers-as-vertically-integrated-product-teams/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Engineers as Vertically Integrated Product Teams","redirects":null}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["4173562750","63159454"]}
